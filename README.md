# Gehl 125 Grinder for Middleburgh

- This Mod is customized for use on the Middleburgh, NY map by Nitrodad1115 (https://nitrodad1115.itch.io/fs22-middleburgh).
- The original Gehl Grinder is part of the Westby, WI map buildings pack by MB Farms. (https://mb-farms.itch.io/fs22-westby-wi-4x-map)
- Suggestion of this conversion came from Mighty Mike Farms (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iu08CES6GAU)

Both mods `FS22_Gehl125_Westby.zip` & `FS22_Gehl125_Middleburgh.zip` are required to be in your mod folder.

## Installation Instructions
1. Download this release, put in your mod folder
2. Download the `WESTBYV2_BUILDINGS_UNZIP.zip` pack from the [Westby, WI download page](https://mb-farms.itch.io/fs22-westby-wi-4x-map) to a temporary location.
3. Unzip the file `WESTBYV2_BUILDINGS_UNZIP.zip`  and copy the zip `FS22_Gehl125_Westby.zip` in your mod folder.
4. Launch the game selecting the Middleburgh, NY map, and "install" only this mod - the original mod just needs to be in your mod folder, but doesn't need to be marked as installed when choosing mods.
5. Purchase the item in game as you normally would, and use as you would expect.

_Note:_ No map related changes are required; Map XML changes are discussed in the linked video, but the way this mod is written makes those changes no longer needed.
