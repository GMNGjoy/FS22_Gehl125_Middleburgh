# Lizard CR 600 for Middleburgh
This is an extension mod for the Lizard CR 600 grinder to add the ability to grind `CRACKEDCORN` and `ROLLEDBARLEY`, as well as adding bulk `fillTypes` for both, and adding both items to the `fillTypeCategories` to allow it to be transported via trailer & stored in a silo in Farming Simulator 22.

Unlike most other mod edits - this mod instead leverages in-game functionality to "extend" the assets & functionality of one mod into this mod without editing or touching the original. Because of this method, it is required to have both mods `FS22_Lizard_CR_600.zip` & `FS22_Lizard_CR_600_Middleburgh.zip` downloaded to your mod folder.

- This Mod is customized for the Middleburgh, NY map by Nitrodad1115 (https://nitrodad1115.itch.io/fs22-middleburgh).
- The original CR 600 is available on ModHub (https://www.farming-simulator.com/mod.php?mod_id=237952&title=fs2022)



## Installation Instructions
1. Download this package from GitHub, put in your mod folder
2. Download the `FS22_Lizard_CR_600.zip` mod from ModHub, and put it in your mod folder.
4. Launch the game selecting the Middleburgh, NY map, and load only the Middleburgh version of the mod - the original mod just needs to be in your mod folder, but doesn't need to be checked as one of your active mods when choosing mods.
5. Purchase the item in game as normal, and use as you would expect.
6. No map-related changes are needed, all custom fillTypes are included in this mod.
