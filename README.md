- This Mod is customized for the Middleburgh, NY map by Nitrodad1115 (https://nitrodad1115.itch.io/fs22-middleburgh).
- The original Gehl Grinder is part of the Westby, WI map by MB Farms. (https://mb-farms.itch.io/fs22-westby-wi-4x-map)
- Suggestion of this conversion came from Mighty Mike Farms (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iu08CES6GAU)
